# Game Inventory System ðŸŽ®

A non-serious fan project of a modular inventory system for games. I may use it in my game projects someday, when I have time.

## Features
- Support for stackable items
- Weight limit for inventory
- Infinite weight (ideal for traders or boxes)
- Adding, searching, and deleting inventory items by id's

### Item tooltip

## TODO
- [ ] Make a demo (OpenGL + ImGui for visualization and demonstration)
- [ ] Add inventory serialization/deserialization
